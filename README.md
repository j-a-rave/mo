 Simple head tracker for Blender, using a basic webcam.

 - Tracks head position (XYZ) and rotation (pitch/roll/yaw).
 - Tracks facial expression (inaccurately), so only reports a generally heightened or dampened mood (vibe up/mid/down).
 - Currently written to be used as a legacy add-on, for ease of development.

Depends on [DeepFace](https://pypi.org/project/deepface/), [face-recognition](https://pypi.org/project/face-recognition/), and [opencv-python](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/).
